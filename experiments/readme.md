# Experiments For *Adpative Pricing in Combinatorial Auctions*

## Overview 

This directory contains the implementation of an (Adaptive Price
Combinatorial Auction*, as well as alternative auctions used as
benchmarks.  It also contains the domain generators
used to create instances on which experiment on the auction, 
code for defining particular experiments, scripts for running
both individual auction instances as a spot check, as well as full 
experiments.

Details on this content and how to use them are provided below.

## Requirements & Setup

To run the auction, you will need 
[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/).  You will also
need install several packages, as specified in 
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/blubin/Adaptive-Price-CA/blob/main/experiments/requirements.txt).
Please install these packages using `pip` as usual.

To run the experiments, you will need a modern `Bash` shell
interpreter.  The scripts were origionally run on linux, but
they should also work on a Mac or on a PC with the `cygwin` 
environment (which provides `bash` on that OS),
